# JARVIS---Voice-Controlled-Virtual-Assistant

This project introduces JARVIS, a browser-based virtual assistant built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It uses the Web Speech API to recognize voice commands and respond through speech synthesis. 
Users can open websites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook, or ask for the current time and date â€” all through voice control.
